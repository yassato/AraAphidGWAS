# Abstract
Growing number of ecological studies have shown that plant developmental and phenological traits greatly contribute to shaping field herbivory. To reveal genetic bases underlying aphid herbivory, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of aphid abundance in a field population of *Arabidopsis thaliana*. Out of a single significant peak on the third chromosome of *A. thaliana*, we isolated *NAME OF THE GENE* (*NOG*) that encoded a ribosomal gene (AT3Gxxxx). Knockout mutants of *nog* exhibited slower growth and ca. x-days later flowering than Col-0. Our laboratory bioassay further showed that a colony of the mustard aphid *Lipaphis erysimi* was difficult to establish on *nog* due to its small rosette size. These findings suggest that side effects of life-history traits on biotic interaction play a more critical role *in natura* than currently appreciated.

# Introduction
Plants are attacked by herbivores across their life cycles in natural environments. While chemical and physical traits have long been a main focus of anti-herbivore defense [@schoonhoven2005insect], plant life-history traits also account for herbivory in field environments [@carmona2011plant; @barton2017future]. For example, phenological shifts can allow plants to escape from seasonal herbivory [@kawagoe2010escape; @marquis2021escape]. Plantsâ€™ visibility for herbivores, namely plant apparency [@feeny1976plant], often changes from vegetative to reproductive phase, which alters the risk of herbivore attacks across plant ontogeny [@zverev2017ontogenetic; @barton2017future]. By focusing on intraspecific variation within a plant species, several studies have shown that plant apparency shapes heritable variation in herbivory among plant genotypes [@johnson2009heritability; @barbour2015multiple; @sato2019plant], though key genes remain unknown.

Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is recognized as a promising approach to dissect the genetic architecture of ecologically important traits [@anderson2011ecological; @santure2018wild] and identify novel genes from natural phenotypic variation [@fujii2019stigmatic; @tsuchimatsu2020adaptive]. However, field studies have suggested that controlled laboratory conditions unlikely reflect outdoor environments where interspecific interactions typically occur [@honjo2020seasonality; @sato2019transcriptional], highlighting the importance of *in natura* study on gene functions [@shimizu2011plant; @kudoh2016molecular; @yamasaki2017genomics]. For *in natura* understanding of interspecific interactions, it is necessary to conduct GWAS under field conditions.

*Arabidopsis thaliana* is the model plant species distributed in Europe and naturalized around the world. While most accessions of *A. thaliana* bloom in spring, some they are also attacked by xxx during early summer [@mosleh2009herbivory; @sato2019plant]. Of diverse herbivores, aphids are a main herbivore [@zust2012natural]. Phenological traits may play a pivotal role in colonization of other organisms (Horton et al. 2014).

In this study, we discovered a new locus *NAME OF THE GENE* (*NOG*) by using GWAS of aphid herbivory on field-grown *A. thaliana*. To conduct GWAS, we first recorded aphid abundance on 196 *A. thaliana* accessions grown in a field site of Zurich, Switzerland. To validate candidate genes, we then cultivated and released the mustard aphid *Lipaphis erysimi* on *A. thaliana* mutants. The field-based discovery of *NOG* will gain genetic insights into plant apparency on insect herbivory *in natura*.

# Materials & Methods

## Study site (subsection)  
Our field survey was conducted in the Irchel-Campus of the University of Zurich....  

## Field survey

## Data analysis  

### Statistical tests (subsubsection)
We used standard linear models or generalized linear model (GLM) to analyze relationship between the plant height and ...  

### Figure presentation (subsubsection)
We added trend lines to the bi-plots following the linear regression model:
$$y = a + bx$$
, where $y$ is the response variable; $x$ is the explanatory variable; $a$ indicates the intercept; $b$ represents the regression slope. Because a log link function was used in the Poisson GLM, a regression curve was given by $y = e^{(a + bx)}$ for the number of seeds.
